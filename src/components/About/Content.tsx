            , a Tier-1 University Transportation Center funded by U.S.
            Department of Transportation. Development of open-source,
            data-driven tools is at the core of TOMNET’s mission to translate
            academic knowledge into practical applications, and the TOMNET
            wellbeing platform serves as a model endeavor of this approach. It
            consists of three activity/time use-based wellbeing indicators – a
            subjective wellbeing indicator called <i>WBEAT</i>, a time poverty
            indicator, and a zero trip-making indicator. Using data from the
            American Time Use Survey (ATUS), the platform can be used to track
            how changes in activity and time use patterns have impacted the
            wellbeing of various population groups on a year-to-year basis.
            These three indicators were developed for different purposes, so
            they provide different perspectives on the wellbeing that can be
            derived from activity and time use patterns. By combining them, it
            is possible to identify racial, economic, and other social
            disparities in society.

            The wellbeing scoring approach used to compute the WBEAT wellbeing
            indicator is an improved version of the original methodology
            documented by Khoeini et al. (2018). The methodology was developed
            based on ATUS data and consists of seven steps summarized below.

              in which respondents were asked to indicate how they felt on six
              measures of subjective wellbeing (happiness, meaningfulness,
              tiredness, sadness, painfulness, and stress) for three randomly
              selected activities in their time use diary. For each measure,
              individuals indicated their feelings on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0
              representing a lack of any intensity on a particular emotion and a
              6 indicating a very strong level of intensity for a particular
              emotion. All the activities for which emotion scores are available
              (from all three years) were compiled into an integrated database.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              All activities were categorized into three groups based on
              location: in-home, travel, and out-of-home. This aimed at
              differentiating the locational influence on feelings.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              The six emotions, taken together, are assumed to define an
              unobserved (latent) wellbeing score. This wellbeing score is not
              explicitly measured. Hence, a latent joint model system
              simultaneously considering all six emotions is formulated. This
              model system relates the latent propensity functions (underlying
              the emotional measures) to an unobserved latent wellbeing score
              that is assumed to be a function of socio-demographic
              characteristics as well as activity-travel attributes. Through
              this formulation, it is possible to estimate a joint wellbeing
              model for each category of in-home, out-of-home, and travel
              activity episodes. Thus, three joint models were estimated.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              The three wellbeing score models were then applied to the ATUS
              records for a given year. The model application process thus
              computes a wellbeing score for each activity in the data set.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              The activity-specific wellbeing scores were normalized so that they
              take a value between zero and one.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              It is assumed that the daily wellbeing score is an additive
              accumulation of all activity-level wellbeing scores computed in
              the prior step. The normalized activity episode wellbeing scores
              for each individual are summed to compute a person-level daily
              wellbeing score. Although these scores do not have a
              straightforward numeric interpretation, they can be used to
              conduct comparisons and assess improvements or degradations in
              wellbeing.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p className="mt-4">
            Here steps 4 through 6 consider an ATUS data set for a single year.
            Steps 4-6 were thus repeated for each year since 2003 to compute a
            person-level daily wellbeing score for each individual.

            Time poverty computation
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
            Time poverty concept is often used to describe individuals who do
            not have enough time to engage in discretionary activities that
            presumably enhance wellbeing. Similar to income-based poverty, time
            poverty is linked to poorer wellbeing. A threshold value is used to
            flag time-poor people based on their available discretionary time.
            The computation method is implemented as follows.
          </p>
          <div className="text-center">
            <img src={tpComputation} alt="TpComputation" width="700px"></img>

          <ul>
            <li className="mt-4">
              Activities of every individual are first classified into three
              distinct categories: necessary activities, committed activities,
              and discretionary activities. The necessary and committed
              activities include personal care (including sleeping and
              grooming), household activities (including housework and food
              preparation), caring for and helping household members (both
              children and adults), and work activities. All other activities
              are treated as discretionary activities.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              For each individual, the time spent on necessary and committed
              activities is computed. The total time spent on these activities
              is subtracted from the daily available total of 1440 minutes (24 hours). The
              remaining time is treated as being available for discretionary
              activities.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              After computing the discretionary time available for each
              individual in the data set, the median discretionary time is
              computed for the entire sample.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              The threshold value for determining time poverty is set to be 60
              percent of median discretionary time. If an individual has at
              least as much discretionary time as this threshold value, then the
              individual is deemed not time-poor (and vice versa). Note that the
              60 percent median discretionary time ranges from one year to
              another (for example, it was found to be 279 minutes for 2019 and
              288 minutes for 2020).
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              These values were then used to identify time-poor respondents in
              the respective years.

            Zero trip-making computation
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
            A situation in which no trips are undertaken throughout the day is
            referred to as zero trip-making. This can lead to feelings of social
            isolation, depression, and other mental health problems as a result
            of not being able to interact in person with others outside the
            home. Zero trip-making is generally seen as a negative indicator of
            wellbeing, indicating that those who do not make any trips in a full
            day may have a lower quality of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to identify zero trip-makers in ATUS data sets. If a
            person's activity time use diary does not report any travel outside
            the home, that person is labeled as a zero trip-maker in the data
            set. If the diary does report travel outside the home, the person is
            labeled as a trip-maker.{" "}
