# W-Beat

WBEAT is developed based on the wellbeing modules available in the 2010, 2012, and 2013 editions of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). It translates time use and activity participation patterns of individuals into wellbeing scores while controlling for their socio-demographic and economic attributes. The estimated scores reflects overall wellbeing of individuals. When these scores are aggregated from person level, they can be used to compare the wellbeing of one group to that of other groups in the population.
